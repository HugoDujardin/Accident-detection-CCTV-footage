# Accident-detection-CCTV-footage
Repository test pour le cours de syst√®me intelligent

Here we have all the files related to a class project about  Intelligent systems.
The goal is to make an intelligent camera capable to detect car accident 
and directly send the position and an image of this incident to the emergency departement.

Description of the files :

- Accident_detection = is use to create and train the AI model
- Accident_video = use the raspberry cam to detect accident
